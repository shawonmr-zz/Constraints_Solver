# Constraints_Solver
This is a genetic algorithm solution for high dimensional, complex constraint solver.
The genetic algorithm has all of its features implemented in genetic.py file.
A sample description of the genetic algorithm that has been followed here:
https://towardsdatascience.com/genetic-algorithm-implementation-in-python-5ab67bb124a6
In case of fitness calculation of the population, the constraint.py has been used that
actually counts the number of given constriants the population solves.

# How to run from command prompt
./main.py input_filename output_filename nresults

# How to run from pycharm edu version
Open the project
Go to Run->Edit Configuration->Configuration->parameters and then add input_filename output_filename nresults
Press apply, ok and then run the main.py. Please make sure that the above input parameters have been 
provide for the main.py file.
